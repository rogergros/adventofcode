# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023: The Ruby Edition 🚀

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 journey! This year, I've decided to tackle the puzzles using Ruby. Why, you ask? Well, Ruby and I have been spending a lot of quality time together in 2023. We've shared laughs, tears, and a few too many late-night learning sessions. At this point, we're practically inseparable. 💎❤️

Happy coding, and may your holiday season be bug-free! 🎅🎉
